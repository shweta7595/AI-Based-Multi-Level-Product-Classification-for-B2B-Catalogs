# AI-Based-Multi-Level-Product-Classification-for-B2B-Catalogs
This project implements an AI-driven product classification pipeline designed to enhance the organization, searchability, and usability of B2B e-commerce catalogs.

It provides an automated workflow to process raw product data, apply multi-level classification, and generate structured category outputs ‚Äî reducing manual effort and improving catalog accuracy.

Features
Automated web scraping pipeline to gather product data.

Data cleaning and preprocessing of raw text and metadata.

Multi-level product classification pipeline using NLP and traditional machine learning models.

Structured category outputs to enhance catalog navigation, search, and analytics.

Scalable and modular design for integration into larger B2B catalog systems.
